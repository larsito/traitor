Description: This packages has two main functionalities (as of version 
    0.0.0.9000). First, it evaluates the availability of trait data for a given 
    community data set and suggests species that beed to be sampled in order to 
    reach a user-defined threshold of data availability. Second, it can 
    demonstrate how different functional diversity indices loose their accuracy
    as trait data is available for less and less species in a community.

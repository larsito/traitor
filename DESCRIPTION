Description: This packages has two main functionalities (as of version 0.0.0.9000). 
    First, it can demonstrate how different functional diversity indices loose 
    their information as trait data is available for less and less species in a 
    community. Second, it helps you to identify species that you need to sample,
    given a minimum amount of species that you want to have trait data for.
